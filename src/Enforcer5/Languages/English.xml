      This system works by only banning images with a 95% or higher chance of being NSFW. It uses the latest in computer vision technology but as this field is still young it is not perfect.

      Here is a post about how to exactly set up NSFW detection:

      Enforcer is a bot designed to help make managing your groups easier. For updates go to https://t.me/{0}.
      It does this by implementing antispam, anti media, tempbans, warnings, allowing you to set responses to hashtags etc.
      * This bot needs to be an admin of the group chat to function properly.
      * This bot functions best in supergroups.
      * It can be configured by sending it /menu.
      * This bot has many commands, to find out more information about a specific command send /help [command] EG: /help menu. To get a list of commands send /getcommands.
      * If you still need help click /support to join our support group.
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="helpOptionNotImplemented">
    <value>
      The information for {0} has not yet been written, please join the /support group to find out more about it.
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="hcommandkickme">
    <value>
      Can be used to make the bot remove you from a group without having to select leave group. For groups that you cannot join when you leave this will allow you to join again.

      Example:
      /{0}
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="hcommandkick">
    <value>
      Can be used to remove a user from a group but allows them to come back.
      It can be used with an id, username or by replying to the person you want kicked.

      Example:
      /{0} while replying to a user
      /{0} [User ID]
      /{0} [Username]
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="hcommandwarn">
    <value>
      Can be used to add a warning to a user, you can set the action taken on max warns and the number of warns a user can get with the menu command.

      Example:
      /{0} while replying to a user
      /{0} [User ID]
      /{0} [Username]
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="hcommandban">
    <value>
      Can be used to ban a user from a group (they cannot come back). If it is used by reply, you can add a reason for the ban behind /{0} which will be shown in status command

      Example:
      /{0} while replying to a user
      /{0} [Reason] while replying to a user
      /{0} [User ID]
      /{0} [Username]
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="hcommandunban">
    <value>
      Can be used to unban a user from a group which will allow them back kf they were previously banned or tempbanned.

      Example:
      /{0} while replying to a user
      /{0} [User ID]
      /{0} [Username]
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="hcommandtempban">
    <value>
      Can be used to temporary ban a user from a group, they will only be able to come back after the time is passed. The command works by banning the user from the group and then unbanning them after the stipulated time.
      Usage:
      You need to reply to the user you want banned. Then when using the command put the number of minutes after the command is sent. If no time is stipulated the bot will ban the user for an hour.

      Example:
      /{0} 123 while replying to a user
      /{0} while replying to a user
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="hcommandadmin">
    <value>
      Can be used to flag a message or call the group admins. If you reply to a message it is forwarded to the group admins along with the text inside your message. If there is no reply just your message is sent.
      The admins are presented with an inline menu of actions to take. In supergroups you can go to the message.
      Example:
      @{0}
      @{0} while replying to a user
      @{0} [reason]
      @{0} [reason] while replying to a user

      /{0}
      /{0} while replying to a user

  </string>
  <string key="hcommandadminoff">

      /{0} [User ID]
      /{0} [Username]

  </string>
  <string key="hcommandadminon">
    <value>

      /{0}
      /{0} while replying to a user
      /{0} [User ID]
      /{0} [Username]
    </value>
  </string>
  <string key="hcommandsolved">

      Here you can change the settings that dicate how the bot handles long names and messages.

      You can set the character limit by sending the following in the group chat:
      /maxnl [number of characters] - to change the max length of a name;
      /maxtl [number of characters] - to change the maximum number of characters in a message;
      /maxl [number of lines] - to change the maximum number of lines allowed in a message.

      The reason you can set lines and characters is that some spammers send blank messages containing many lines. These messages will be below the character count but will still be spammy.
